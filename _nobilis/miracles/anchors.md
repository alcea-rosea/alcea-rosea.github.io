# Anchors

An Anchor is a person, place, thing, or collection of such that is connected to you through a Bond. [p209] Anchors are claimed by using Treasure Miracles. [p209]

### How many Anchors can a character have?

- The maximum number of Anchors is limited by the number of Bonds. Each Bond may claim only one Anchor or collection of Anchors at a time. [p209]
  - Any one Bond can only claim one Anchor or collection of related Anchors at a time. [p209]
  - You can spend unallocated Bond points during play to claim more Anchors. [p209]
  - Claiming an additional Anchor when you have no more available Bonds will inflict a Wound on you, which gives a Wound-related Affliction or Bond relevant to the Anchor. [p209]
  - You can take a Treasure-based Gift to have an Anchor-like relationship to a person or thing called a "Focus" without needing a relevant Bond. [p222]

### What kinds of Anchors are there?

## Ordinary Anchors

- Ordinary Anchors are ordinary people and things with no magical or miraculous power. [p208]
- Rarely, when it makes sense and with HG and players' permission, you can temporarily stretch an Ordinary Anchor beyond its limits and treat it as if it were a Wondrous Anchor or Miraculous Anchor to use higher-level Miracles, but either you or the Anchor will take a Wound chosen by the HG. [p216] Alternatively, you can permanently upgrade an Ordinary Anchor to a Wondrous Anchor using *Unleashing Wonders* [p211] or (rarely, when it makes sense) to a Miraculous Anchor using *Unleashing Miracles*. [p214]

Listed below are useful actions that can be done with Ordinary Anchors and the relevant Treasure Miracle Levels required to do them:

--|--|--
0 | [p209] | claim an Ordinary Anchor, optionally making it best of its mundane class and/or free of all maintenance.
  |  | reflexively open a communication channel with an Anchor that is trying to reach you.
1 | [p210] | temporarily possess an Anchor's body instead of your own via a mystic link 
2 | [p211] | guide and assist an Anchor via a mystic link while remaining in your own body 
3 | [p211] | upgrade an Ordinary Anchor into a Wondrous Anchor
4 | [p212] | cause your Anchor to strengthen or aid you in some way
4 |  | cause your Anchor to reach you within a city- or Chancel-sized region
5 | [p213] | temporarily boost an Ordinary Anchor with the power of an Aspect 3 Miracle to unleash them as a tool, cause them to strengthen or aid you, or cause them to wound or disrupt something
6 | [p214] | declare that the Anchor leverages the power you grant them to create a specific outcome, possibly requiring a sustained miracle over a reasonable period of time for this outcome to be acheived.
6 |  | upgrade an Ordinary Anchor into a Miraculous Anchor
7 | [p215] | cause your Anchor to reach you no matter where you are

## Wondrous Anchors

- Wondrous Anchors are people and things with an extraordinary (often magical) power, comparable to a lesser miracle in scope. [p208] [p212]
- You can temporarily stretch a Wondrous Anchor beyond its limits and treat it as if it were a Miraculous Anchor to use higher-level Miracles, but either you or the Anchor will take a Wound chosen by the HG. [p216] Alternatively, you can permanently upgrade a Wondrous Anchor to a Miraculous Anchor using *Unleashing Miracles*. [p214]

Listed below are useful actions that can be done with Wondrous Anchors and the relevant Treasure Miracle Levels required to do them:
