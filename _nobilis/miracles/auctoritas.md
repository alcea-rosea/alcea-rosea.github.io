# Auctoritas

Auctoritas (pronounced: "owk-TOHR-ee-tahs", plural: Auctorita) protects something from miracles, requiring the hostile miracle to add extra power in the form of Strike, regardless of the miracle level [CITATION NEEDED]. When a hostile miracle has enough Strike points in it to match the rating of the Auctoritas, the Auctoritas is ignored; otherwise, the hostile miracle fails to penetrate the protection of the Auctoritas, and the thing or property protected by it is preserved. [p109]

### Where do Auctorita come from?

- Afflictions are defended by an Auctoritas equal to the rating of the Affliction, [p167] so all sources of Afflictions are also sources of Auctorita.

- Miraculous characters can shield themselves (or another thing or group) in an Auctoritas Magister by spending MP (of any type) up to their Persona rating. [p318]

- A mundane action that was learned using a difficulty 9 Aspect Miracle (*Mastered Technique*) is protected by a level 4 Auctoritas, to compensate for the fact that it is not actually a miracle after you've mastered the technique. [p183]

- A dharma that was instilled using a difficulty 9 Persona miracle (*Greater Binding*) is protected by a level 4 Auctoritas. [p204]

- The typical Chancel has a boundary Auctoritas of rating 2, though this can vary between 1 and 5 depending on the preferences of those designing the Chancel; this opposes both inbound and outbound miracles that cross the boundary. [p246]

- An Actual always has some level of Auctoritas protecting its nature. [p301]

## Auctoritas Magister

- Miraculous characters can shield themselves (or another thing or group) in an Auctoritas Magister by spending MP (of any type) up to their Persona rating. [p318]

- An Auctoritas Magister protects only people, things, and mortal actions - it doesn't protect miracles performed by those people. [p318]

- Invoking the Auctoritas Magister is not reflexive, and sustaining it requires a sustained action. [p318]

- More MP can be spent later to strengthen an existing sustained Auctoritas Magister, but this counts as a separate action, and the total strength cannot exceed the Persona rating. [p318]

- If your Auctoritas Magister protects you from an opposing miracle, and your opponent sustains that miracle, you must sustain the Auctoritas Magister longer than your opponent sustains the miracle to remain protected from the effect. [p318]

- The Auctoritas Magister is invisible (except in its effects), but it can be noticed by other miraculous characters in the moment you invoke it. [p318]
