# Treasure

Treasure is the trait representing the capacity of a miraculous character to establish and manipulate Anchors. [p208] A miraculous character can cast miracles through a remote Anchor as if they were present, but are also vulnerable to being attacked through the Anchor when the mystic link between the two is open. [p207]

#### Additional Resources

Treasure and Anchors are complex, and a small additional book called [*The Story of Treasure*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115109/The-Story-of-Treasure) was released as a free PDF to help players better understand these mechanics. This site will not link to page numbers from that PDF, but some of the mechanical interpretations appearing here are informed by that resource. It's recommended reading for anyone trying to better understand Treasure.

### How do Treasure Miracles relate to other Miracles?

- Sustained Treasure Miracles that enable new kinds of mundane actions (such as *Unleashing Wonders* [p211]) can be used alongside Aspect Miracles to enhance those mundane actions. [p212] [p305]

- While using a Treasure Miracle like *Possession* [p210] that allows you to occupy the body of your Anchor instead of your own, you can use your own Miracles in that body. [p211]

### How else does Treasure affect a character?

- Beyond the base 13 points of Bonds and Afflictions a character can spend, they can spend an additional number of points on Bonds equal to their Treasure rating (because claiming Anchors for Treasure Miracles requires having relevant Bonds).
