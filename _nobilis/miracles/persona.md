# Persona

Persona is the trait representing the capacity of a miraculous character to manipulate the dharma of people and things in ways that relate to their Estate. [p186] Most of these Miracles derive their effects from the Estate Properties of that character's Estate. [p197]

### How do Persona Miracles relate to other Miracles?

- A Persona Miracle represents a single command, but effects from multiple [Miracle Levels](#miracle-levels) can be used together, as long as those effects are the components of a single command. [p306]

- You can perform Persona Miracles alongside sustained Aspect Miracles (or vice versa) to wield their effects with supernatural prowess. [p305]

### How else does Persona affect a character?

- A character gets free points of Shine equal to the level of their Persona trait. [p155]

- A character's maximum level of Auctoritas Magister is equal to the level of their Persona trait. [p318]

### Can a character have multiple Estates?

- Yes, while rare, a character may divide Persona points among multiple different Estates. [p197]
  - All Estates share the same pool of Persona MP.
  - Each Persona rating must be at least level 1.
  - The Persona rating of each "secondary" Estate must be equal or less than that of the "primary" Estate.

- Taking a secondary Estate of "things of my Chancel" is a common way to increase a character's power inside their Chancel. [p246]

- Imperators always have multiple Estates, using almost the same rules. [p260]
  - The only difference is that they are allowed to have Domain and Persona level 0 for their Estates.

### Can characters other than Powers have Estates?

- An Imperator has the Estates of all of their Powers. [p260]

- An Erus lives in a Chancel and has a pseudo-Estate of "things of the Chancel". [p245]

- A Deceiver typically has a self-referential pseudo-Estate, but uses only Persona, and not Domain [p278].

- A Warmain typically has a pseudo-Estate of the mechanism of their test, but uses only Domain, and not Persona [p283].

- A Mimic uses the same rules as Imperators for having multiple Estates [p287].
