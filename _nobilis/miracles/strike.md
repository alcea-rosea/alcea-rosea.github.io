# Strike

Strike is extra power added to a miracle to overcome an opposing miracle's Auctoritas. [p110] It is also a form of Miraculous Edge, decreasing the effective miracle level of your opponent. [p110]

### Where does Strike come from?

- Spending "one or more MP" [NEEDS CLARIFICATION A] "of any sort" [NEEDS CLARIFICATION B] on a miracle will add that many points of Strike to it. [p319]
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION B] - Does this mean that Strike for a Domain miracle can come from another trait, like Aspect? Can MP expenditure be divided between multiple pools for the same miracle?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION A] - Is MP expenditure for Strike limited by the 1,2,4,8 rule? Does MP added for Strike count toward the Word of Command 8 MP limit? If I spend 8 MP on a trait of 0 to do a level 5 miracle, does that give me 3 Strike?

- If you have one or more Bonds driving you to do the miracle, you get free points of Strike equal to the rating of the highest relevant Bond. [p163]
  - A relevant Setting Property can be invoked as if it were a Bond with a rating of 2. [p315]

- When doing a reflexive difficulty-zero miracle of Domain (*Estate-Driven Divination*) [p188], Persona (*The Sight*) [p198], or Treasure (hearing an Anchor trying to communicate with you) [p210], you get free points of Strike equal to your rating of that trait.

- When using a Gift that spent points to include Strike, you get free points of Strike equal to that designed amount. [p223]
  - Sample Gifts that recommend spending points to include Strike are *Gatemaker* [p234] and *Worldwalker* [p239].

### How is total Strike calculated?

```
[number of MP spent on Strike]
+ [highest relevant Bond or Setting Property rating]
+ [relevant trait rating, if a reflexive difficulty-zero miracles]
+ [innate Strike points, if a Gift]
```
