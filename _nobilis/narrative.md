# Narrative Mechanics

- Bonds and Afflictions describe the nature of your character and what drives them to action, which can be leveraged in play to both their advantage and disadvantage.

- Projects are character goals that explicitly denote the stories that the players want to tell in play; Destiny is earned by struggling to acheive those goals.
