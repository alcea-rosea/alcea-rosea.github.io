# Aspect

Aspect is the trait representing the capacity of a miraculous character to bend reality to perform natural kinds of physical and mental actions with supernatural effectiveness. [p115] At higher Aspect levels, these actions become less like natural actions and more like fantasies. [p179] Using Aspect Miracles lets characters bypass the Intention system for mortal actions. [p153]

## Miracle Levels

0 | *Peak Performance* [p179] | mortal actions [Passion/Skill + 3]
1 | *Enhanced Performance* [p180] | mortal actions [Passion/Skill + 4]
2 | *Pulp Heroism* [p180] | mortal actions [Passion/Skill + 5]
3 | *Inhuman Perfection* [p180] | ... and flawless grace, execution, and timing

### How do Aspect Miracles relate to other Miracles?

- An Aspect 3+ Miracle can be used by a character to quickly familiarize themselves with a specific instance of a collection of Anchors. [p208]

- A single Aspect Miracle action can be comprised of a range of related sub-actions in one fluid motion. [p304]

- You can perform Aspect Miracles alongside other kinds of sustained Miracles (or vice versa) to wield their effects with supernatural prowess. [p305]

### How else does Aspect affect a character?

- A character gets free points of Cool equal to the level of their Aspect trait. [p154]
