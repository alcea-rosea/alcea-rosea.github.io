# Bonds

A Bond is a statement of truth about a character which is part of their dharma. [p161] Unlike an Affliction, a Bond is a promise the character must keep through their own effort. [p161]

It's up to you as a player to determine when your Bond applies during play and the efforts that you put forth to enforce its truth. [p162]

### What does a Bond say about you?

Just like an Affliction, a Bond is any of the following kinds of statements: [p161]

- Something you *must* (or *ought to*) do.
- Something you *can't* (or *shouldn't*) do.
- Something that drives you into action.

### How do Bonds come to be?

- Chosen at character creation. [p161]
  - Beyond the base points to allocate to Bonds and Afflictions, you get extra points of Bonds equal to your chosen Treasure rating. [p209]

- Shuffled and tweaked between Stories (or at any time with HG consent). [p176]

- Temporarily applied by suffering a Surface Wound. [p324]
  - The Bond rating is typically 2 when inflicted by a lesser miracle, or 4 for a greater miracle, but the HG may choose any Bond rating 1-5.

- Each Setting Property of the World or Chancel that you're in should be treated as a Bond with a rating of 2 while in that particular environment. [p315]

### When do Bonds come into play?

- Add Strike to a miraculous action equal to the rating of the highest relevant Bond. [p163]
    - A Bond can also add Strike to a Gift. [p223]

- Add the mundane equivalent of Strike to a mundane action. [p163]

- Claim an Anchor or collection of related Anchors. [p209]
  - Any one Bond can only claim one Anchor or collection of related Anchors at a time. [p209]
  - You can spend unallocated Bond points during play to claim more Anchors. [p209]
  - Claiming an additional Anchor when you have no more available Bonds will inflict a Wound on you, which gives a Wound-related Affliction or Bond relevant to the Anchor. [p209]

- When your Bond gives you trouble, or you strongly exemplify the Bond in play, you gain some MP. [p164]
  - The amount of MP is at the HG's discretion (minimum 1).
  - For mortal characters, the reward is usually points of Will (maximum equal to the rating of the Bond).
  - Because Bonds are player-controlled, you can get yourself into trouble with your Bond at any time you choose. [p165]

- You can sometimes use your Bonds to prevent character death. [p164]
  - Surviving off of a Setting Property as if it were a Bond may taint you with the nature of that environment, which manifests as a Wound with an Affliction that describes your dependence on that environment. [p315]

- When a Bond is non-trivially broken during play, the character takes a Wound. [p165]
  - The maximum possible Wound is determined by the Bond rating: [p165]
    - Surface Wound (rating of 1)
    - Serious Wound (rating of 2-3)
    - Deadly Wound (rating of 4)
    - Two Deadly Wounds (rating of 5)
  - This Wound counts as "giving you trouble", for the purposes of gaining MP. [p165]
  - Note that you'll also gain a Wound-related Affliction for each Serious Wound (Affliction rating 1) [p325] or Deadly Wound (Affliction rating 1-5). [p326]

- When you get someone into trouble with their Bonds or Afflictions, force them to break a Bond, or make their Affliction paradoxical, you can perform the Nettle Rite to gain the same amount of MP they gained for their trouble. [p340]
